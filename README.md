# Python-Assignment2
**Overview:**
This assignment contains two basic Python programs focused on conditional logic and loop operations. These programs are designed to help beginners practice user input handling, decision making, and loops.

**Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd**
**Problem Statement:**

Write a Python program that:

1.Takes an integer input from the user.

2.Checks whether the number is even or odd using an if-else statement.

3.Displays the result accordingly.

**Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop**
**Problem Statement:**

Write a Python program that:

1.Uses a for loop to iterate over numbers from 1 to 50.

2.Calculates the sum of all integers in this range.

3.Displays the final sum.
